    <p>A deep dive into building a real-time attendance system using face recognition and machine learning.</p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In my final year of engineering, I worked on developing an automated attendance system that uses facial recognition technology to track student attendance in real-time.</p>
    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The system was built using Python and OpenCV for image processing, along with deep learning models for facial recognition.</p>
    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>One of the main challenges was ensuring accurate recognition in different lighting conditions. We solved this by implementing...</p>
